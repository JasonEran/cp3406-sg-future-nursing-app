## Project Overview

[cite_start]The Elderly Care Coordination Platform tackles a significant real-world challenge: the logistical and emotional difficulty of coordinating care for an elderly loved one, particularly one with a condition like dementia[cite: 3]. The application aims to replace fragmented communication channels (like group chats and phone calls) with a single, reliable source of truth for all care-related activities. [cite_start]It is designed for family caregivers, the elderly individual, and potentially healthcare professionals, ensuring everyone stays informed and synchronized in real-time[cite: 4, 7].

## Core Features

The application is being developed with a focus on reliability, collaboration, and ease of use.

* [cite_start]**Multi-User Collaboration:** Built from the ground up for team-based care, featuring a shared activity feed for full transparency[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Role-Based Access Control:** Assign roles (e.g., 'Primary Caregiver') to manage data access and ensure privacy and security[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Shared Care Plan:** A real-time, synchronized plan for medications, appointments, and daily routines, preventing missed events and confusion[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**High-Priority Reminders:** Utilizes robust system services to deliver critical alerts that cannot be easily missed, even when the device is in a low-power state[cite: 20, 24].
* [cite_start]**"Today's View" Dashboard:** A central dashboard providing an at-a-glance summary of the day's tasks‚Äîwhat's due, what's completed, and what's been missed[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Data Portability & Deletion:** Empowers users with the ability to export their data and permanently delete their account[cite: 17].

## Architectural Design

This project adopts a modern, offline-first architecture using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern. This separation of concerns ensures the application is scalable, testable, and maintainable.

* **UI Layer (View):** Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, responsible for observing state changes from the ViewModel and rendering the UI.
* **ViewModel Layer:** Holds and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It exposes state to the UI and handles user interactions.
* **Data Layer (Model):** Manages all application data and business logic. It follows the "single source of truth" principle, using a **Repository Pattern** to abstract data sources (local database vs. network).
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt will be used to manage dependencies, reducing boilerplate and improving code structure.

## Technology Stack

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
* **Jetpack Compose:** For building the entire UI declaratively.
* **Material Design 3:** For UI components and design language.
* [cite_start]**Room Database:** For robust, offline-first data persistence[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**WorkManager & AlarmManager:** For scheduling reliable, deferrable, and guaranteed background tasks and critical reminders[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Foreground Services:** For persistent, long-running operations like ongoing reminders[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Jetpack DataStore:** For securely storing simple key-value data like user preferences or auth tokens[cite: 25].
* **Coroutines & Flow:** For managing asynchronous operations throughout the app.
